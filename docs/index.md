title: MyST extension for JupyterLab
description: The MyST Markdown JupyterLab extension switches the default markdown rendering in JupyterLab to MyST. Allowing notebook authors to create richer content using MyST roles and directives alongside plain markdown to create notebook based content from technical tutorials though to publication-quality documents with bibliography support.

Render markdown cells using [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/), including support for rich frontmatter, interactive references, admonitions, figure numbering, tabs, cards, and grids!

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_myst
```

## Features

`jupyterlab-myst` is a fully featured markdown renderer for technical documents, [get started with MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/docs/mystjs/quickstart-myst-markdown). It supports the MyST `{eval}` inline role, which facilitates the interweaving of code outputs and prose. For example, we can use inline expressions to explore the properties of a NumPy array.

In the code cell:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.arange(4)
```

In the markdown cell:

```markdown
Let's consider the following array: {eval}`array`.

We can compute the total: {eval}`array.sum()` and the maximum value is {eval}`array.max()`.
```

This will evaluate inline, and show:

```text
Let's consider the following array: array([0, 1, 2, 3]).

We can compute the total: 6 and the maximum value is 3.
```

You can also use this with `ipywidgets`, and have inline interactive text:

Or with `matplotlib` to show inline spark-lines:

You can also edit task-lists directly in the rendered markdown.

## Usage

[MyST][myst-quickstart] is a flavour of Markdown, which combines the experience of writing Markdown with the programmable extensibility of reStructuredText. This extension for JupyterLab makes it easier to develop rich, computational narratives, technical documentation, and open scientific communication.

### Execution üöÄ

To facilitate inline expressions, `jupyterlab-myst` defines a `jupyterlab-myst:executor` plugin. This plugin sends expression code fragments to the active kernel when the user "executes" a Markdown cell. To disable this functionality, disable the `jupyterlab-myst:executor` plugin with:

```bash
jupyter labextension disable jupyterlab-myst:executor
```

### Trust üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Jupyter Notebooks implement a [trust-based security model](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html). With the addition of inline expressions, Markdown cells are now considered when determining whether a given notebook is "trusted". Any Markdown cell with inline-expression metadata (with display data) is considered "untrusted". Like outputs, expression results are rendered using safe renderers if the cell is not considered trusted.
Executing the notebook will cause each cell to be considered trusted.

To facilitate this extension of the trust model, the `jupyterlab_myst` server extension replaces the `NotebookNotary` from `nbformat` with `MySTNotebookNotary`. This can be disabled with

```bash
jupyter server extension disable jupyterlab-myst
```

The `MySTNotebookNotary` adds additional code that makes it possible to mark Markdown cells as trusted.

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_myst
```
